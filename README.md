Here's a `README.md` file template for a MERN stack application that clones the functionality of GitHub, with authentication handled by Passport.js and GitHub OAuth:

# GitHub Clone (MERN Stack)

## Overview

This project is a GitHub-like clone built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The application replicates some of the core features of GitHub, including repository management, user profiles, and more. Authentication is managed using Passport.js with GitHub OAuth, allowing users to sign in using their GitHub accounts.

## Live Demo
The service is live and can be accessed at (https://github-mern-app-6eey.onrender.com)

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure authentication using GitHub OAuth through Passport.js.
- **Repository Management:** Users can view repositories.
- **User Profiles:** Each user has a profile page displaying their repositories and other information.
- **Search:** Search functionality to find repositories and users.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js with Hooks and Context API for state management
  - React Router for navigation
- **Backend:**
  - Node.js and Express.js for RESTful API development
  - Passport.js for authentication
  - MongoDB with Mongoose for database management
- **Authentication:**
  - Passport.js with GitHub OAuth strategy

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.x or higher)
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sajal-2003/github-clone.git
    cd github-clone
    ```

2. **Install server dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following environment variables:**

    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
    SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
    CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:5000/auth/github/callback
    ```

5. **Run the MongoDB server:**

    Make sure your MongoDB server is running. You can start it using:

    ```bash
    mongod
    ```

6. **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

7. **Start the frontend server:**

    Open a new terminal window and run:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
    ```

8. **Access the application:**

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the homepage of the GitHub clone.
